# Visualize

A picture earns its place only when it shows something words can't — shape, structure, direction, relationship, geometry. This skill produces ONE such picture, guarantees it is **correct** (the maker renders it and looks at it before returning), and drops it into the lesson so it renders inline in the Obsidian lesson file.

You are the **creative director**. You decide the exact idea and distill it to
its fewest carrying elements. A **maker** does the authoring, rendering, visual
verification, and saving, then returns a filename. Prefer a maker subagent; if
the host cannot delegate, perform the same render-and-inspect loop directly.
You embed the verified filename in your reply.

## When to visualize (and when not to)

This teaching system builds a **dependency graph in the learner's head** — axioms at the root, derived facts hanging off them. A visual is powerful exactly when it makes that structure (or a geometry) visible. Reach for one when:

- The idea is a **structure or relationship**: dependencies, a system with parts and arrows, a flow/pipeline, a sequence of exchanges, a state machine, a tree/hierarchy, a comparison, a containment (what's inside vs outside).
- The idea is **spatial or geometric**: coordinate geometry, a number line, vectors, a function's shape, a physical arrangement.

Do NOT visualize when prose or a single equation already carries it. A decorative diagram that just restates the sentence next to it adds noise and a chance to be wrong. When in doubt, don't — a missing visual is cheaper than a false one.

## Choose the maker

Two maker roles:

- **`mermaid-maker`** — structural/relational visuals: dependency graphs, flowcharts, sequence/state/ER/class diagrams, trees, mindmaps, timelines. This is the default and fits the dependency-graph pedagogy directly.
- **`svg-maker`** — spatial/geometric visuals Mermaid can't lay out: exact coordinates, geometry figures, number lines, vectors, plots, custom shapes.

Rule of thumb: if it's *nodes-and-edges / relationships*, use mermaid-maker. If it's *positions-and-shapes / geometry*, use svg-maker.

## Brief the maker well: one idea, fewest elements

The most common failure is **cramming** — every extra label makes the picture harder to read AND harder to lay out correctly. Before briefing, prune to the fewest elements that carry the idea, and for each ask: *"if I delete this, is the idea still clear?"* If yes, delete it.

Give the maker the concept AND the concrete elements you want — not a vague topic, and not a long checklist.

- BAD: "make a diagram about how TCP works"
- GOOD: "graph TD: a node 'packet' at the top; arrows down to 'ordering' and 'retransmit on loss'; both arrows down into 'reliable stream'. No title. Show that reliability is built FROM packets, not alongside them."

Keep the idea intact but trust the maker to compose; if your brief lists more than ~5–7 elements, cut it first.

## Invoke

Dispatch the maker using the host's subagent mechanism. In Claude Code, use the
named `mermaid-maker` or `svg-maker` agent. In Codex, spawn a general subagent
with the corresponding role name and include the render-and-inspect contract
below. If delegation is unavailable, execute that contract directly.

The task MUST include the absolute lesson directory (`<lessondir>`, e.g.
`$HOME/Documents/DANIEL ZAUROFF/learning/<slug>`) so the maker knows where to
publish. It may only touch files under `<lessondir>/viz/`:

```
Agent(subagent_type="mermaid-maker", prompt="Lesson directory: <absolute lessondir>. <your minimal, concrete brief>")
```
```
Agent(subagent_type="svg-maker", prompt="Lesson directory: <absolute lessondir>. <your minimal, concrete brief>")
```

The maker owns the render-and-inspect loop with the host's shell, file-editing,
and image-viewing tools: author the source, render it to a PNG, **look at the PNG
and iterate until it is correct and clean**, publish it into `<lessondir>/viz/`
with a unique filename, and return:

```
RESULT:
filename: viz-<slug>-<timestamp>.png
path: <lessondir>/viz/viz-<slug>-<timestamp>.png
```

If it returns `RESULT: NONE`, it couldn't make a correct picture of the brief —
simplify or rethink, or decide the visual isn't worth it. Never publish an
uninspected diagram; correctness depends on the render-and-inspect loop.

## Embed it in the lesson

Put the embed directly in your teaching reply, using a standard Markdown image with a path **relative to the lesson file** (not a wikilink — a relative path renders in both Obsidian and image.nvim):

```
![](viz/viz-<slug>-<timestamp>.png)
```

In Claude Code, the learn-log Stop hook mirrors the reply into the lesson file.
In Codex or another host without that hook, also add the embed to the active
lesson file using the host's file-editing mechanism. The lesson file lives at
`<lessondir>/<date> <topic>.md` with the image at `<lessondir>/viz/...`, so the
relative path resolves from the lesson file's directory. Introduce the visual
in a sentence, then let it carry the idea; do not narrate every element back in
prose.

## Why this is reliable

- The maker never returns a picture it hasn't **looked at**, so "renders fine but says something false" is caught before it reaches the learner.
- PNG embed means **what the maker verified is pixel-identical to what the learner sees** — no re-render drift.
- Unique filenames keep multiple diagrams in the same lesson from colliding.
